# On Reviewing a Hacker

The purpose of reviewing a hacker is to assure that the hacker's profile is as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible.

In [a specific segment](http://www.npr.org/2013/10/04/191621516/is-too-much-collaboration-a-bad-thing) of [an episode of the TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/2013/07/13/197986218/why-we-collaborate) it was discussed that one pitfall in any office environment is so many meetings and discussions _about_ work, that there's no time left to actually _do_ the work. For this reason, it is recommended that the _maximum_ frequency of reviews on any specific hacker be no more than once every three months. An exception _can_ be made, however, for a hacker who expresses _specific_ difficulty finding a compatible group.

At the beginning of the review session, make sure that the hacker being reviewed understands what the review is for, what it entails, and is okay with it. Specifically, do not forget to ask if it's okay for the reviewer to enter the profile and update what is necessary.

Though asking the hacker what zir basic skills are is necessary, that is only a first step. Often, a hacker will have skills that zie does not mention because zie only listed what zie could think of off the top of zir head. Furthermore, there may be skills that the hacker omits because zie does not realize that they can be relevant to civic hacking. Taking the conversation in informal directions (after the basic run-down of skills is complete) and discussing what this specific hacker does for a living, as well as any _other_ hobbies this specific hacker has, can help in this regard. To know what skills can be gleaned from this, it can help if the reviewer knows what skills are needed by projects, which is why it is recommended that the same reviewers be used for reviewing hackers as for [reviewing workgroups] (as opposed to having different reviewers specialize on the two kinds of reviews).

In the same vein, knowing the life-story of the hacker being reviewed can shed light on some overlooked skills.
