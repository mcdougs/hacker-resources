# On Reviewing a Workgroup

The purpose of reviewing a workgroup is to assure that the workgroup's profile is as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible.

In [a specific segment](http://www.npr.org/2013/10/04/191621516/is-too-much-collaboration-a-bad-thing) of [an episode of the TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/2013/07/13/197986218/why-we-collaborate) it was discussed that one pitfall in any office environment is so many meetings and discussions _about_ work, that there's no time left to actually _do_ the work. For this reason, it is recommended that the _maximum_ frequency of reviews on any specific workgroup be anywhere from once a month to once every seventy days, depending on the group's level of activity.
