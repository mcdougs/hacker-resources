# On Reviewing a Hacker

The purpose of reviewing a hacker is to assure that the hacker's profile is as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible.

In [an episode of the TED Radio Hour](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ted-radio-hour/id523121474?mt=2&i=334734386) it was discussed that one pitfall in any office environment is so many meetings and discussions _about_ work, that there's no time left to actually _do_ the work. For this reason, it is recommended that the _maximum_ frequency of reviews on any specific hacker be no more than once every three months.
